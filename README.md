It is also available in the Unity Asset format: [here](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/zara-survival-engine-182386#description).

The code in repo represents release `v1.06` with no changes on top.

All you need to do to include Zara into your project - is to grab `Zara` folder with its `cs` sources, and you're done!

## Description

Zara will be useful for you if you want your game to have weather-aware **health control** with ton of intertwined parameters, **sleeping**, **fatigue**, **diseases** (flu, food poisoning, venom poisoning, angina and so on), **injuries** (cuts, fractures), **food spoiling**, **water disinfecting**, **inventory**, **crafting**, **clothes** with different water/cold resistance levels and more. On a surface, it is really easy to [set up](https://github.com/vagrod/zara/wiki/Getting-Started) and use.

Code is open, so you can customize everything for your particular game needs.

Saving/Loading of the engine state is fully supported: more on it [here](https://github.com/vagrod/zara/wiki/How-To-Save-and-Load-Engine-State) and [here](https://github.com/vagrod/zara/wiki/Add-Stuff-to-State-Saving-and-Loading).
***
Zara is a complete package with full implementation of the inventory system with crafting. Everything, including built-in inventory, will be saved and loaded on your demand, you don't have to worry about this low-level stuff, and you can dedicate more time to the actual game making.

Zara is talking to your outside game world via [events](https://github.com/vagrod/zara/wiki/Handling-Zara-Events) (you can subscribe and listen to them from anywhere).

Zara will not eat your game performance: it is re-evaluating health state and all needed internals only once a second (you can customize this to be any number).

Zara is aware of the [game surroundings](https://github.com/vagrod/zara/wiki/Setting-Up-Weather-Description) if provided (air temperature, wind speed, rain intensity, time of day), and will adjust its parameters dynamically (in a hot day water will drain faster; in rainy cold day it is more likely to get flu, and so on.)
